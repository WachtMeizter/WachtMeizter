- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WachtMeizter. I go by Lore and many other names.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in so, so many things. 
 I'm a creative at heart, so while programming doesn't always come naturally, I've learned to power through the annoying and boring bits for the sake of problem-solving. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to implement DirectX11 with C++. I've also started dabbling in JavaScript for the sake of future web development.
